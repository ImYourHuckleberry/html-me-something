                <h3>Step Two: Pick a Class</h3>
                <p>I see you dont have any class (HA!)</p>
                <p>When you pick a class you pick what type of adventurer you are going to be</p>

                <h3>Step Three: Your Ability Scores and You</h3>
                <p>Ability Scores are your characters base stats that determine chances of success for a given action</p>
                <p>In DnD 5th Edition there are six ability scores that make up the bulk of your charater</p>
                <div class = "list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Stregnth - Ability associted with feaths of brawn and muscle. Necessary for heavy armor and swinging big weapons.</li>
                    <li>Constitution - Effects your base health. How big of a hit can you take? How long can you hold your breath? Ever wonder of you could survive a good poisioning?</li>
                    <li>Dexterity - Speed and reflexivness. Effects most armor bonuses (excluding heavy), and can influence how well dexterity weapons can be used.</li>
                    <li>Wisdom - Effects the perception of the character. Did you notice the feet behind the curtain? The book on the book case that is just a little out of place?</li>
                    <li>Intelligence - Book smarts and such. You may not be street wise but if it can be read in a book you've read it.</li>
                    <li>Charisma - Charm and persuasion. A character with high charisma can charm their way out of a situation that others may find themselves getting bloody over.</li>
                </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Because this is your first game we are going to divide up scores in the most simple way. The basic point spread</p>
                <p>In what ever order you decide place these six scores: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8</p>
                <p>Keep in mind that the adverage person has a "10" for most abilities, so you will be above adverage for most, and below adverage for one ability.</p>

                <h3>Step Four: Create a Backstory</h3>
                <p>It's time to throw some meat on your characters bones.</p>
                <p>Did you come up on the streets? WEre you born into a noble house, but are now cast aside? Are you a Holy Warrior who has become dissillusioned?</p>
                <p>This is one of the best parts of DnD, you can be anything you want to be. So take a while, and really consider whose skin you want to live in while you play this game.</p>

            <h3>Playing Dress Up</h3>
            <p>Finally, you need to outfit your character with some gear.</p>
            <p>Here is where you decide if you are playing with a sword and sheild, or a two-handed Great Axe. If you are going to use a staff or a wand. If you are going to wear full plate mail or just some leather straps</p>
            <p>There are pros and cons to everything so pick wisely. That heavy armor is hard to sneak in, and that bastard sword takes up one too many hands for a sheild.</p>
